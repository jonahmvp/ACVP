1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing Password-
   based KDF implementations using ACVP.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   This document also refers to the following terms and definitions:

3.  Supported KDFs

   The following key derivation functions *MAY* be advertised by the
   ACVP compliant cryptographic module:

   o  ACVP-KDF-PBKDF

4.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   Password-based KDF implementations.  There is only one test type:
   functional tests.  Each has a specific value to be used in the
   testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

   "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed by
   the client using a normal 'derive_key' operation.  AFTs cause the
   implementation under test to exercise nomral operations on a single
   block, multiple blocks, or partial blocks.  In all cases, random data
   is used.  The functional tests are designed to verify that the
   logical components of the key deriviation process are operating
   correctly.

4.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to XXX.

5.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for more details on
   the registration message.

5.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation *MAY* rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, XXXXXX.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

   Prerequisites, if applicable, *MUST* be submitted in the registration
   as the 'prereqVals' JSON property array inside each element of the
   'algorithms' array.  Each element in the 'prereqVals' array *MUST*
   contain the following properties

   +--------------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+
   | JSON         | Description              | JSON Type | Valid       |
   | Property     |                          |           | Values      |
   +--------------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+
   | algorithm    | a prerequisite algorithm | string    | XXX         |
   | valValue     | algorithm validation     | string    | XXX         |
   |              | number                   |           |             |
   +--------------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+

   A "valValue" of "same" *SHALL* be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   capability exchange looks like this

6.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual algorithm defined during the
   capability exchange.  This section describes the JSON schema for a
   test vector set used with Password-based KDF algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+
   | JSON Values | Description                             | JSON Type |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+
   | acvVersion  | Protocol version identifier             | string    |
   | vsId        | Vector set identifier                   | integer   |
   | algorithm   | Algorithm defined in the capability     | string    |
   |             | exchange                                |           |
   | mode        | Mode defined in the capability exchange | string    |
   | revision    | Protocol test revision selected         | string    |
   | testGroups  | Array of test groups containing test    | array     |
   |             | data                                    |           |

   An example of this would look like this

   {
           "acvVersion": "version",
           "vsId": 1,
           "algorithm": "Alg1",
           "mode": "Mode1",
           "revision": "Revision1.0",
           "testGroups": [ ... ]
   }

6.1.  Test Groups

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the Password-based KDF JSON elements of the
   Test Group JSON object

   +----------+----------------------------------------------+---------+
   | JSON     | Description                                  | JSON    |
   | Values   |                                              | Type    |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------+---------+
   | tgId     | Test group identifier                        | integer |
   | hmacAlg  | The hash algorithm used in HMAC              | string  |
   | testType | Describes the operation the client should    | string  |
   |          | perform on the tests data                    |         |
   | tests    | Array of individual test cases               | array   |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------+---------+

   The 'tgId', 'testType' and 'tests' objects *MUST* appear in every
   test group element communicated from the server to the client as a
   part of a prompt.  Other properties are dependent on which 'testType'
   the group is addressing.

6.2.  Test Cases

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each Password-based KDF test vector.

7.  Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | acvVersion    | The version of the protocol | string    |
        | vsId          | The vector set identifier   | integer   |
        | testGroups    | The test group data         | array     |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

   An example of this is the following

   {
           "acvVersion": "version",
           "vsId": 1,
           "testGroups": [ ... ]
   }

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   *SHALL* require the client to send back group level properties in
   their response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

         +---------------+---------------------------+-----------+
         | JSON Property | Description               | JSON Type |
         +---------------+---------------------------+-----------+
         | tgId          | The test group identifier | integer   |
         | tests         | The test case data        | array     |
         +---------------+---------------------------+-----------+

   An example of this is the following

   {
           "tgId": 1,
           "tests": [ ... ]
   }

   The following table describes the JSON object that represents a test
   case response for a Password-based KDF.

         +---------------+--------------------------+-----------+
         | JSON Property | Description              | JSON Type |
         +---------------+--------------------------+-----------+
         | tcId          | The test case identifier | integer   |
         | derivedKey    | The outputted key        | hex       |
         +---------------+--------------------------+-----------+

   Here is an abbreviated example of the response
